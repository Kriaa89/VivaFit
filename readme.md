# Fitness & Workout Tracker App – Product Backlog

This backlog outlines the key features and tasks for the Fitness & Workout Tracker application. It is organized into major functional areas, including core app features, the marketing website content, and necessary developer documentation updates. The language and structure are kept clear and student-friendly, following an industry-standard style for product backlogs.

## 1. User Registration & Authentication
- **Secure Sign-Up & Login:**  
  Implement user registration and login using email/password with Firebase Authentication. Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for session security to keep user data safe.
- **Post-Login Onboarding:**  
  After the first login, prompt the user to complete a profile form collecting personal details – age, weight, height, fitness level, fitness goals, workout preferences, any dietary restrictions, and preferred workout times. Save these details to personalize the user’s experience.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Provide clear error messages for invalid sign-up or login attempts (e.g., incorrect credentials, email already in use) to guide users in correcting issues.

## 2. Dashboard Overview
- **Progress Summary:**  
  Design a dashboard that gives users an overview of their fitness journey. Display key stats like number of completed workouts this week, current streaks, and progress toward their goals.
- **Goal Tracking:**  
  Show visual indicators (progress bars or summaries) of the user’s fitness goals (e.g., weekly workout target or weight loss goal) so they can easily track how close they are to achieving them.
- **Recommended Exercises & Insights:**  
  Highlight a few recommended workouts or exercises for the day, tailored to the user’s profile and recent activity. Optionally include AI-generated insights or tips (e.g., congratulatory notes on progress or recommendations for a recovery day).
- **Smartwatch Sync Status:**  
  If the user has connected a smartwatch or fitness tracker, display a status indicator (e.g., “Synced with Fitbit”) to confirm data is up-to-date.
- **Weekly Weight Reminder:**  
  Include a widget or reminder on the dashboard prompting the user to update their weight once a week with a simple notification or designated section.

## 3. Profile Management
- **Editable Personal Details:**  
  Allow users to view and update their profile information at any time, including name, age, weight, height, and fitness level. Ensure changes are saved securely.
- **Fitness Preferences:**  
  Enable users to adjust their fitness goals (e.g., switching from “Weight Loss” to “Muscle Gain”) and workout preferences (preferred workout time, equipment availability, etc.), influencing the app’s recommendations.
- **Weight Log & Progress:**  
  Provide a section where users can record their weight on a weekly basis (or other frequencies) with a history or chart depicting their weight loss/gain progress.

## 4. Tailored Workout Plans
- **Personalized Plans:**  
  Generate customized workout plans for each user based on profile data – body type, fitness level, available equipment, and fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, endurance). For instance, a beginner aiming for weight loss with no equipment might receive a bodyweight exercise plan.
- **Modify or Regenerate Plans:**  
  Allow users to adjust their plan manually, regenerate a new plan, or swap out certain exercises, ensuring flexibility and user comfort.
- **AI-Generated Insights (Optional):**  
  Optionally integrate an AI component to provide insights on the chosen plan, such as explaining the benefits of interval training for endurance.

## 5. Exercise Exploration
- **Exercise Library:**  
  Build a browsable library of exercises that users can explore, with the ability to search or filter by muscle group (e.g., chest, legs, core) and available equipment (e.g., dumbbells, resistance bands, no equipment).
- **Filter & Search:**  
  Implement advanced filtering by exercise type, difficulty level, or required equipment to help users quickly find exercises matching their interests.
- **Detailed Exercise Info:**  
  For each exercise, offer detailed instructions, identification of the primary muscles, equipment requirements, and include images or illustrations fetched via the ExerciseDB API or similar.

## 6. Workout Tracking
- **Logging Workouts:**  
  Enable users to log completed workouts, whether following a planned session or an ad-hoc exercise routine, with optional details like duration, reps, or notes.
- **History & Dashboard Updates:**  
  Record every logged workout in the user’s history and update the dashboard overview to reflect new workouts (e.g., increasing the weekly count, updating goal progress).
- **Progress Feedback:**  
  Display motivational feedback such as streaks (e.g., consecutive workout days) or messages like “You’ve completed 5/5 workouts this week – goal achieved!”

## 7. Goal Setting & Progress Visualization
- **Goal Definition:**  
  Allow users to set specific, measurable fitness goals, whether quantitative (e.g., “Exercise 4 times per week” or “Run 10 km this month”) or outcome-based (e.g., “Lose 5 kg in 3 months”), including deadlines or frequency targets.
- **Visual Tracking:**  
  Present progress toward each goal with visual tools like charts or graphs (e.g., bar charts for weekly workouts, line graphs for weight trends) and highlight milestones.
- **Achievements & Notifications:**  
  Trigger notifications or achievement badges when users reach their goals or milestones and send motivational reminders when deadlines approach.

## 8. Weekly Weight Update & Weight Loss Tracking
- **Regular Weight Logging:**  
  Encourage users to update their weight every week, with a dashboard reminder prompting input.
- **Trend Visualization:**  
  Provide a dedicated view (e.g., a line graph) to plot weight trends over time, allowing users to track their progress.
- **Insight & Recommendations:**  
  Analyze logged weights to offer feedback, such as suggestions to adjust calorie intake or try new cardio if a plateau is detected, or positive reinforcement if progress is on track.

## 9. Smartwatch Integration
- **Connect Fitness Devices:**  
  Allow users to link their smartwatches or fitness tracking apps (e.g., Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit) so that workout data (runs, steps, heart rate) can be automatically synced.
- **Auto-Sync Workouts:**  
  Automatically integrate workout activity from connected devices into the app’s workout history, ensuring data consistency.
- **Manual Sync Option:**  
  Provide a “Sync Now” button for manual data syncing, especially useful when auto-syncing fails or after connecting a new device.
- **Data Consistency:**  
  Merge external device data (calories burned, duration, etc.) with the app's own tracking to provide a comprehensive view of the user’s fitness activities.
