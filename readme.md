# Fitness & Workout Tracker App – Product Backlog

This backlog outlines the key features and tasks for the Fitness & Workout Tracker application. It is organized into major functional areas, including core app features, the marketing website content, and necessary developer documentation updates. The language and structure are kept clear and student-friendly, following an industry-standard style for product backlogs.

## 1. User Registration & Authentication
- **Secure Sign-Up & Login:**  
  Implement user registration and login using email/password with Firebase Authentication. Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for session security to keep user data safe.
- **Post-Login Onboarding:**  
  After the first login, prompt the user to complete a profile form collecting personal details – age, weight, height, fitness level, fitness goals, workout preferences, any dietary restrictions, and preferred workout times. These details will be saved to personalize the user’s experience.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Provide clear error messages for invalid sign-up or login attempts (e.g., incorrect credentials, email already in use) to guide users in correcting issues.

## 2. Dashboard Overview
- **Progress Summary:**  
  Design a dashboard that gives users an overview of their fitness journey. Display key stats like number of completed workouts this week, current streaks, and progress toward their goals.
- **Goal Tracking:**  
  Show visual indicators (progress bars or summaries) of the user’s fitness goals (for example, weekly workout target or weight loss goal) so they can easily track how close they are to achieving them.
- **Recommended Exercises & Insights:**  
  Highlight a few recommended workouts or exercises for the day, tailored to the user’s profile and recent activity. Include AI-generated insights or tips (optional feature) – for example, a note congratulating the user on their progress or suggesting a recovery day if needed.
- **Smartwatch Sync Status:**  
  If the user has connected a smartwatch or fitness tracker, display a small status indicator (e.g., “Synced with Fitbit”) to confirm data is up-to-date.
- **Weekly Weight Reminder:**  
  Include a widget or reminder on the dashboard prompting the user to update their weight once a week. This could be a simple notification or section saying “Don’t forget to log this week’s weight.”

## 3. Profile Management
- **Editable Personal Details:**  
  Allow users to view and update their profile information at any time. This includes name, age, weight, height, and fitness level. Changes should be saved securely to their account.
- **Fitness Preferences:**  
  Let users adjust their fitness goals (e.g., switch from “Weight Loss” to “Muscle Gain”) and workout preferences (preferred workout time, equipment availability, etc.). These settings directly influence the recommendations the app provides.
- **Weight Log & Progress:**  
  Provide a section in the profile for users to record their weight on a weekly basis (or any frequency). Display a history or chart of these weight entries so users can track their weight loss/gain progress over time.

## 4. Tailored Workout Plans
- **Personalized Plans:**  
  Generate customized workout plans for each user based on their profile data – including body type, fitness level, available equipment, and stated goals (such as weight loss, muscle gain, endurance). For example, a beginner aiming for weight loss with no equipment might get a bodyweight exercise plan.
- **Modify or Regenerate Plans:**  
  Give users the option to adjust their plan. They might regenerate a completely new plan or swap out certain exercises if something isn’t working for them. This ensures flexibility and personal comfort with the routine.
- **AI-Generated Insights (Optional):**  
  Integrate an AI component to provide insights on the plan. This could include explanations for why certain exercises were chosen or tips on how to get the best results. (For instance, an AI tip might explain the benefit of interval training for the user’s endurance goal.)

## 5. Exercise Exploration
- **Exercise Library:**  
  Build a browsable library of exercises that users can explore. Users should be able to search or filter exercises by muscle group (e.g., chest, legs, core) and by equipment available (e.g., dumbbells, resistance bands, no equipment).
- **Filter & Search:**  
  Implement filters to improve searchability – for example, filter by exercise type, difficulty level, or equipment. This helps users quickly find exercises that meet their criteria or interests.
- **Detailed Exercise Info:**  
  For each exercise, show detailed information fetched via the ExerciseDB API (or a similar exercise database). Details may include step-by-step instructions, the primary muscles worked, any required equipment, and if possible an image or illustration of the exercise. This allows users to learn new exercises and proper form.

## 6. Workout Tracking
- **Logging Workouts:**  
  Enable users to log when they complete a workout. If they followed one of their planned workouts or did an ad-hoc exercise session, they should be able to mark it as done (and optionally record details like duration, reps, or notes).
- **History & Dashboard Updates:**  
  Every logged workout is recorded in the user’s workout history. The dashboard overview should update to reflect newly completed workouts (for example, increasing the count in the weekly summary and contributing to goal progress).
- **Progress Feedback:**  
  Use the logged data to give users a sense of accomplishment. For instance, show streaks (if they worked out multiple days in a row) or a highlight like “You’ve completed 5/5 workouts this week – goal achieved!” in the dashboard or history section.

## 7. Goal Setting & Progress Visualization
- **Goal Definition:**  
  Allow users to set specific fitness goals in the app. Goals could be quantitative (like “Exercise 4 times per week” or “Run 10 km in total this month”) or outcome-based (“Lose 5 kg in 3 months”). The app should let users input these goals and a target deadline or frequency as appropriate.
- **Visual Tracking:**  
  Present the user’s progress toward each goal in a visual format. This might include charts or graphs – for example, a bar chart showing workouts per week against a weekly goal, or a line graph showing weight change toward a target weight. Milestones can be indicated (like a marker when half the goal is achieved).
- **Achievements & Notifications:**  
  When a user reaches a goal or hits a significant milestone, trigger a congratulatory notification or badge. For instance, if a user’s goal was to run 10 km in a month and they hit it, the app could display an achievement badge on the dashboard. Similarly, gentle reminders or motivational notifications can be sent if the deadline is approaching and the goal is not yet met.

## 8. Weekly Weight Update & Weight Loss Tracking
- **Regular Weight Logging:**  
  Encourage users to update their weight every week. The dashboard’s weight reminder (from item 2) will prompt this. Users enter their current weight, and the app adds it to their weight log history.
- **Trend Visualization:**  
  Provide a dedicated view or chart for weight trend over time. For example, a simple line graph that plots weight on the Y-axis and time on the X-axis, so users can see their weight decreasing, increasing, or fluctuating week by week.
- **Insight & Recommendations:**  
  Analyze the weight data to give users feedback. If the user’s goal is weight loss and the chart shows a plateau or increase over a few weeks, the system might display a gentle suggestion such as “Your weight has been steady for 3 weeks. Consider adjusting your calorie intake or trying a new type of cardio.” Conversely, if the user is on track, the app can encourage them with a message like “Great job! You’re steadily losing weight.” These insights help keep the user informed and motivated based on their personal data.

## 9. Smartwatch Integration
- **Connect Fitness Devices:**  
  Provide an option for users to connect their smartwatches or fitness tracking apps (e.g., Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit). This connection allows the app to read workout data (like runs, steps, heart rate) directly from the device.
- **Auto-Sync Workouts:**  
  When connected, the app should automatically sync relevant workout activities from the smartwatch. For example, if a user records a run on their Apple Watch, that run should appear in the app’s workout history without manual entry.
- **Manual Sync Option:**  
  Include a manual “Sync Now” button as a fallback. This lets users trigger a sync on demand, useful if automatic sync fails or if they just connected a new device and want immediate data transfer.
- **Data Consistency:**  
  Ensure that data from the smartwatch (calories burned, workout duration, etc.) is merged with the app’s own tracking so the dashboard and progress visuals reflect all activity. The integration should be seamless, giving users a comprehensive view of their fitness activity in one place.

## 10. Social & Community Features (Future Enhancement)
- **User Connections:**  
  Allow users to find and connect with friends or other fitness enthusiasts within the app. This could include searching by username or integrating with contacts/social media to find friends who also use the app.
- **Sharing Progress:**  
  Enable users to share updates about their fitness journey – for example, posting that they completed a workout or achieved a goal. A simple feed or timeline could display these updates for friends to see, with options to like or comment (for encouragement).
- **Challenges & Competitions:**  
  Introduce community challenges, such as weekly step counts or a month-long workout streak challenge. Users can join challenges and see leaderboards or collective progress, adding a friendly competitive element to motivate everyone.
- **Community Guidelines:**  
  If social features are added, ensure there are clear guidelines and moderation tools in place to keep the community supportive, safe, and positive.

## Developer Setup Guide Updates

- **Post-Login Profile Data:**  
  Update the setup guide to indicate that after a successful authentication via Firebase, the app should prompt new users to complete a profile form (collecting details such as age, weight, height, fitness level, etc.) and ensure these details are sent to Firebase and stored with the user’s account.
- **Firebase Data Storage:**  
  Instruct developers on extending the Firebase user model or database schema to securely store additional fields (e.g., fitness level, goals, preferences, dietary info, preferred workout time) while enforcing strict security rules for user data.
- **Dynamic Recommendations & Analytics:**  
  Document how the workout recommendation engine and analytics modules should pull the latest user profile data. This ensures that any updates to personal details immediately reflect in personalized workout plans and progress charts.
- **Unchanged Auth Flow:**  
  Reiterate that aside from the added post-login profile step, the core Firebase JWT-based authentication remains unchanged. The new profile form is an enhancement and does not overhaul the standard auth configuration.
