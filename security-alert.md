# URGENT SECURITY ALERT

## Compromised Firebase Service Account

Your Firebase service account credentials have been accidentally exposed. These credentials include your private key and can grant full access to your Firebase project.

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Revoke this service account key immediately**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
   - Find the service account `firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@vivafit-c32e5.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Delete or rotate the key with ID: `dc20716cce9a944c8e11ea43f59ef03472141b49`

2. **Generate a new service account key**
   - Create a new key for your service account
   - Store it securely in a .env file or secure secrets manager
   - Make sure it's included in your .gitignore

3. **Update your application**
   - Replace the old credentials with the new ones in your application
   - Ensure your Firebase service account file is properly protected

4. **Audit your Firebase project**
   - Check for any suspicious activity
   - Verify database rules and security settings
   - Make sure no unauthorized changes were made

5. **Secure your development process**
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials
   - Implement a secrets management solution
   - Consider using GitHub's secret scanning capabilities

Remember: Service account keys should NEVER be committed to version control or shared in plain text. They grant administrative access to your Firebase project.
