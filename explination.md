## Features
- **Frontend Integrated UI:** Responsive design with intuitive dashboards and real-time feedback.
- **Backend API Endpoints:** Robust RESTful services for authentication, token management, and user profile operations.
- **User Registration & Verification:** Secure registration with email/password and optional email verification.
- **JWT-Based Authentication:** Stateless session management using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Token Refresh & Logout:** Short-lived access tokens with accompanying refresh tokens.
- **Password Recovery:** Secure password reset workflow via email.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define and enforce permissions based on user roles.
- **Audit Logging & Monitoring:** Detailed activity logs for security audits and performance monitoring.
- **Scalability:** Designed for high-volume authentication requests.
- **Integration-Ready:** RESTful APIs that work with mobile and web clients.

## System Architecture
The system is structured as a microservice:
- **Auth Server:** Core service (Node.js/Express) exposing authentication APIs.
- **Database:** Stores user profiles, hashed passwords, and token data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- **Client Applications:** VivaFit web and mobile clients that interact with the Auth Server.
- **External Services:** Email/SMS services for verification and password reset.

### User Registration Workflow
Submit Registration: User submits his/her details using a frontend form. The backend validates the input for duplicate emails and securely hashes passwords before creating the user profile.
Email Verification (Optional): The backend dispatches a verification token that the user activates using the client interface.

### User Login Workflow
Credentials Submission: The user logs in via the frontend, which sends credentials to the backend.
Authentication: The backend validates the credentials, issues JWT access and refresh tokens, and the frontend establishes a secure session with these tokens.

### Token Refresh & Session Management Workflow
Detect Expiration: The frontend monitors token expiry and triggers a request for a new access token.
Request New Token: The backend validates the refresh token and provides new tokens, ensuring continuous user sessions.

### Password Reset Workflow
Initiate Reset: The user triggers a password reset from the frontend, prompting the backend to send a secure reset token via email.
Reset Password: The user provides a new password along with the reset token in the frontend, and the backend updates the user credentials securely.
Testing
Run the test suite to verify functionality:

bash
Copier
npm test
This will execute unit and integration tests for registration, login, token refresh, and other features.
